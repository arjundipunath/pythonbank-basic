## 🏦 PythonBank - Basic Console Banking System

This is a **simple console-based banking application** built with Python. It serves as a project for beginners and intermediate developers to practice core programming concepts like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, control flow, functions, and data manipulation.

### ✨ Features

The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform fundamental banking operations:

  * **Create Account:** Register a new customer with an initial deposit.
  * **Deposit Funds:** Add money to an existing account.
  * **Withdraw Funds:** Remove money from an existing account, with a check for sufficient balance.
  * **Check Balance:** View the current balance of an account.
  * **Simple Data Storage:** Account data is managed in memory (or a simple file/dictionary structure, depending on the implementation).

### 🤝 Contributing

This project is a great starting point. If you would like to contribute, consider implementing these extensions:

  * **Data Persistence:** Implement saving account data to a file (like a CSV or JSON) so that data is not lost when the program closes.
  * **Error Handling:** Add more robust input validation and error handling for common mistakes.
  * **Transaction History:** Implement a feature to track and display a history of deposits and withdrawals for each account.
